##TODO:

1. Make git repo WITH README
  * Project Name
  * Elevator Pitch (2 sentence-ish description of the idea)
  * Project Requirements (e.g. CRUD, etc)
  * Feature List (Outline, short list of 2-3 things)
  * What interesting query/report/insight will your app have?
  * If you're pulling data from somewhere, where will you be getting it? Include a link to documentation or data
2. Put some of that sample data in your repository in a directory named 'data'
2. Get Feedback on that (either in class tomorrow or via. a quiz)
3. Wait for the feedback
4. Write user stories for your features
5. Draft an ERD for your project
6. Actually start with tests. TEST driven development.
