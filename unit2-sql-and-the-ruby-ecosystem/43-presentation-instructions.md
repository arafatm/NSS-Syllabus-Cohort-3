# Presentation Instructions

Each presentation should take approximately 5 minutes and cover the following material:

1. Goals (30 seconds)
  * Pull these from your elevator summary, user stories and/or README
2. Demo (2 minutes)
  * You don't have to demonstrate all of the functionality, just the high points.
3. Lessons Learned (1 minute)
  * This can be cathartic!
4. Question and Answer time (2 minutes)
  * There will be questions, I promise.  Ask for questions and then pause while people gather their thoughts.

## Important points to remember:

* You do not need a slide deck unless you want one.  It can be helpful, but is definitely optional.
* If you have a slide deck through an online service, ensure that you have a local copy of it just in case the internet is spoty tomorrow.
* Speak loudly and clearly, facing your audience.
* DO NOT emphasize broken parts of the program.  If you notice a bug while you're presenting, just gloss past it. This is an important skill to learn for giving product demos.
* DO NOT insult your own work.  People tend to take a person's self-evaluation at face value and you'll simply be setting people up to think your work is sub-par.
* Avoid referencing other student's presentations in a "well, they covered everything I had to say on my lessons learned".  Your presentation should stand alone.
* Your presentation and work should be complete by 9AM Tuesday morning.  You are expected to have your laptop closed and your attention on the presenter.
