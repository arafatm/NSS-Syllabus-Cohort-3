## Pete's reminder about Sandi Metz:

> I talked with a couple people in class this afternoon about testing and how to sort out what to test and how.  Tonight I watched Sandi Metz's talk about testing (I think Eliza first mentioned it) and it was amazing.  It makes the process seem borderline simple and straightforward.  I think the half our of watching the video would be recouped in the next hour of coding.  Here is the link:

## Lar's reminder about running tests in isolation:

> If you don't have a handy reference yet, here's how you run isolated tests.
>
> Run one individual test:
>
>      ruby path_to_test_file -n individual_test_name
>
>        example:
>
>      ruby test/test_searching_songs.rb -n test_search_returns_relevant_results
>
>
> Run all tests from one test file:
>
>
>      rake test TEST=path_to_test_file
>
>        example:
>
>      rake test TEST=test/test_searching_songs.rb
>
>
> Run all integration tests:
>
>      rake test:integration
>
> Run all unit tests:
>
>      rake test:units


## Anonymous student's advice on asking for help:

> Here's a great article by Patty Azzarello (great thought leader on leadership and career, who hasn't sacrificed her soul, and gives practical, non-BS advice) on how asking for help is critical to success in work and life, http://www.tlnt.com/2012/11/28/asking-for-help-or-how-i-reached-out-and-became-an-accidental-expert/
>
> "The most successful people get the most help.
>
> They are not so successful because they are so great and smart on their own. Itâ€™s because they get the most help."
>
> I think it would come across wrong if I sent this out to the cohort, but if you think it's useful to send it out (without mentioning me) feel free to.
