# Projects for Unit 2 Capstone:

## Goal:

* Develop and demonstrate a command of SQL (using SQLite3)
* We will later refactor this application to user ActiveRecord

## Criteria:

* It should be a command-line CRUD app (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* You can use gems
* Should be relatively simple feature list, as the focus is on SQL mastery

## Project Ideas:

* A todo app
* Personal library tracker
* Family Tree
* Journaling
* Exercise tracker
* Meal planning
* Recipe Tracker
* Contact Manager

## Order of Operations:

1. Select Projects
2. Write requirements and user stories
3. Plan the database structure
4. Write the application
5. In-class project presentations
6. Refactor to use ActiveRecord (DO NOT start with this)
